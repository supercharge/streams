## Introduction
The native Node.js stream implementation is based on event emitters. Itâ€™s hard to manage the control flow in your application when using events. If you want to actively wait for a stream to finish, you must wrap it into a promise.

This `@supercharge/streams` package wraps Node.js streams into promises to make them `async/await`-ready. It provides methods, like

- `.map(callback)`
- `.filter(callback)`
- `.through(transformStream)`

to interact with the input data.


## Installation

```
npm i @supercharge/streams
```


## Docs
Find all the [details for `@supercharge/streams` in the extensive Supercharge docs](https://superchargejs.com/docs/streams).


## Usage
Using `@supercharge/streams` is pretty straightforward. The package exports a function that accepts data or a read-stream as an input. If the input is not a stream, it transforms it into one.

Hereâ€™s an example that takes an array with three items and runs it through a streaming pipeline to ultimately writing the result to a file:

```js
const Stream = require('@supercharge/streams')

await Stream([1, 2, 3])
  .inObjectMode()
  .map(item => {
    return item * 2
  })
  .filter(item => {
    return item > 3
  })
  .into(Fs.createWriteStream('./numbers-greater-then-three.csv'))
```

The `.map()` and `.filter()` methods take a callback as an argument. Under the hood, `@supercharge/streams` creates a transform stream for these methods to run the provided callback.


### Object Mode Streams
Object mode streams come handy when working with arrays to retrieve each item from the array individually.

By default, a stream is not in object mode. You must actively chain the `.inObjectMode()` method in the pipeline:

```js
const Fs = require('fs')
const Stream = require('@supercharge/streams')

const users = [
  { name: 'Marcus', supercharged: true },
  { name: 'Red John', supercharged: false }
]

await Stream(users)
  .inObjectMode()
  .filter(user => user.supercharged)
  .into(Fs.createWriteStream('./supercharged-users-export.csv'))
```


### Error Handling
The native Node.js streams use event emitters and this comes with separate channels for data and errors. The `@supercharge/streams` package transforms the event-based streams into promise-based streams. Promises have a single channel for data and errors.

You must actively catch errors if you donâ€™t want them to bubble up in your appplication:

```js
try {
  await Stream(input)
    .map(() => throw new Error('sh*t happens'))
    .into(output)
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
}
```

Errors will be thrown as soon as they appear. The stream will stop and clean up without processing the remaining data.
